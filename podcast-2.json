And we're ready to podcast. Hi, I'm De La Bonde, and this is Mega, a podcast that normally belongs to my mom, but I've taken it over today because, you know, there's stuff I want to talk about on here, and she'll probably delete it later, whatever. I'm very excited because I'm here to talk to Jenny McGrath, a very rad person who knows a bunch of stuff that I want to know. So, hi Jenny, welcome to Mega the Podcast. Hi, thank you so much for having me. Really excited to be here with you today. Oh, yeah, awesome. Okay, I do hope my mom does not delete this later. Okay, so I found Jenny on Instagram because I was watching one of her videos where she was talking about purity culture, and I've actually been raised with this huge, massive importance placed on purity. And when honestly, Jenny, when I first heard you talking about purity, you were talking about it like different than I was used to it as a subject matter, and you were making points that like felt like kind of subversive to me, and like I was like, okay, let's go. So I wanted to talk to you and also share her with all of you all out there. So, okay, Jenny is a licensed mental health counselor. She's a somatic experiencing practitioner and a purity culture researcher. I'm going to ask you about some of those words later too, but it's all really cool. So Jenny, like how did you get interested in this stuff? Yeah, that's such a great question, and I really connect with what you just said about how what you heard me say is not really what you've heard a lot in perhaps church or the culture at large, because I myself grew up in purity culture. I grew up in Colorado Springs, which is sort of one of the epicenters of white evangelical Christianity. And I also grew up in the 90s, and so it was a particular height in the purity culture movement. And so I was deeply, deeply impacted by it growing up. I begged my parents for a purity ring when I turned 13 years old. Oh, wow. Yeah. And as part of that world, you know, I really wanted to be good. And I believed that the best, goodest possible thing I could do was to become a missionary. So I actually moved to Northern Uganda as a 19 year old and spent a few years there on and off. And it was really my own body that actually led me to my current profession, because after a few years there, my body sort of broke down. I got shingles and my nervous system and my immune system just kind of stopped working. And so it led me on a really long journey of researching and understanding trauma's impact on the body. And so it started out with my own lens and my own experience in my body. And then for the last eight years, I've been a mental health counselor, working primarily with other white women who grew up in purity culture and realizing time and time again the different themes that happen for folks who are socialized into these systems, both in their personal body and in our collective bodies. Whoa, yeah. That's really cool. How were the 90s? I loved so much about the 90s. I think it was such a fun time to be alive. It's so weird to me that folks of your generation call it the 1900s, because it doesn't actually feel that long ago to me, but I'm reckoning with my age at this point. That's so cool that you lived in another century. So maybe I'll start with, I'm always banging around on this drum of the idea of consent, and mostly just because my mom told me not to and because she says it's like a slippery slope and it's about self-importance and it takes our eyes off of God's plan, basically. I don't know. I can just tell that the very concept of consent is a threat to my biblical upbringing. I don't know. I didn't understand consent for a long time, to be honest, Jenny, because I thought it was the papers you have to sign when you go to paintball. Because one time my friend Jean Carlo, he put a fake name on the paintball paper, and he said his name was Seymour Butz, and they didn't catch it at first, and we started the game, but then they stopped us and they kicked us out. Now we have to do Whirly Ball, which sucks. I thought consent was like that, where you were like, it's okay if I get a concussion in paintball. But do you know what consent is and why it's important or why it's threatening? Yeah, totally. I love that story. I think that's hilarious. That is a type of consent. What you were writing on that paper was your name and you're agreeing to do something. And so at its core, that is all consent is. It is saying my agency, my autonomy, my individuation is online, and I am choosing to say yes to this. And I'm choosing that I'm going to be responsible for whatever the consequences of this are. And so I think that consent is incredibly important because it allows us to understand our own choices and the impact that they might have. And I think some of the reasons why it can be threatening in certain Christian spaces is that there can actually be sort of this glorification of hive mind and of really just doing what other people do without really questioning, is this what I want to do? Is this something that feels good in my body? Is this something that I'm willing to pay the consequences for if I choose to do it? And I think that consent really requires us to have a good awareness of our body, which in my experience and in many people's experience who grew up in purity culture, there is actually a disembodiment and a disassociation from the body that happens. And I think part of this is actually intentional because it keeps us doing what the system might want us to do. Mina Salami says, tyrants have always understood that the more robotic people are, the more easily manipulated they are. Whoa, yeah. Yeah. Does that connect with you a little bit? Yeah, that's so cool. I'm going to say that. I'll quote it to Salami though. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that's part of consent is embodiment, is knowing our body, what we want to say yes to and what we want to say no to. And unfortunately, consent often isn't taught in abstinence only education, which leads to a lot of confusing situations for folks of all genders, whether they actually chose to engage in a sexual interaction or not. And so that can create at best confusion and at worst, it can often lead to harm and abuse and assault. Whoa. Yeah. So, okay, you said a bunch of words that I can already tell are why my mom, doesn't want me to worry about consent or even think about it or learn about it or apply it or whatever, because basically, yeah, we're not supposed to feel our bodies because our bodies are bad and dirty and will drag us straight to hell. Like there's Bible verses, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. And like, you know, we've been taught that like our spirit can be like saved through the redemptive power of, you know, what Jesus did on the cross and all that stuff. But our body is like a real problem. So you're basically saying that your body isn't wrong and bad and disgusting and gross. And that if you listen to it, it will tell you, yes, this is good for me. No, like, I guess it's even, I guess, a thing where I'm like, I just don't like coconut. No offense, none taken. But I'm not going to have an almond joy if I could have a whatchamacallit or a three musketeers. So I'm like that. So like, so are you saying like if I do it like that with candy bars, I'm like, look, I don't want to eat an almond joy because I don't like it. I'm not saying nobody can eat almond joy, but I am just not giving you consent to put an almond joy in my mouth. But you can put a three musketeers in my mouth. Is that it? Absolutely. Absolutely. And consent is really connected to this other phrase that you can remember or not remember. It's not important in the actual words, but it's called our hedonic tone. And our hedonic tone is our sense of what we like and what we don't like. And the more in tune with and the more robust we are in our hedonic tone, the more clear we can be to say, yes, I like this candy bar. No, I don't like hiking in the rain. Whatever it might be, we get to have more of a sense of autonomy and agency over our own body. Wow. And yeah, that is definitely a threat to the idea of like you have to be on God's plan all the time and you have to be seeking God's will. Because if I was like, well, I'm checking in with my body and I'm aware of like what feels good to me and what feels bad to me, then, you know, my mom would be like, that isn't what's important. God's will is important. So, yeah, because I do see like that. I think a lot of stuff with God in the Bible, like God doesn't really get consent because he's like, I'm God. I'll do whatever I want type of thing. Absolutely. Yeah. And that was something that was really hard and honestly still is hard. It's still something I have to kind of unconscious or very consciously unprogram in my own brain because it was messages I heard my entire life. And one of the things that helped me is understanding that the current idea about soul and body actually wasn't what the original writers of the Old or New Testament had in mind. It was really formulated through Plato and through the idea, it wasn't until essentially Plato that the soul was seen as separate than the body. So before then, it was the idea that my body and soul are both animated through my breath, through the breath of God, through my spirit that gives me life. And so some of this has been a journey of learning more about the history of the theologies and the doctrines and the dogmas that were taught and where they come from that has helped me have a healthier relationship to my own body. Whoa! That makes sense because I've looked into that too, that it was important for Jesus to touch the holes in my hands and see that I'm alive physically because Jesus at that time in human whatever it's called, humans didn't... The people who spoke Aramaic at the time Jesus was alive in the region where Jesus was alive, they had no idea of a soul, but life only existed in a alive body. So it was very important that he was like, look, my body's alive. So that makes total sense. But yeah, I guess it really benefits Christians to kind of parse it out like that, even though it doesn't even technically make sense even based on their own text. That's interesting. Whoa! Okay. And it's also funny because I have a friend, Austin at school, who says that they're asexual. And I'm like, how do you know if you've never had sex? And they're like, I just don't want to. And I know that and I'm not interested in it and I'm asexual. And I'm like, okay, which actually seems like that would be really great for Christian parents if their kids told them that maybe we should all just tell them that. I'm not condoning lying, but okay. So, but I guess, I don't know, you can even be an alcoholic genetically, even if you never have a sip of booze, you just wouldn't know because you never got hammered or something. Maybe that doesn't make sense. But okay, I want to come back. Can we talk about purity culture, Jenny, a little more? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So like, I've been to like purity balls for friends of mine who are girls. Have you ever been to a purity ball? I have, yes. Oh, I want to hear about yours. Okay, because for those of you out there who don't know, like it's the one I went to for my friend Madison, Mackenzie, it's a lot like a wedding, but like instead of two grownups committing their love and devotion to each other publicly, it's a teenage daughter kind of committing her virginity to her father publicly for him to be the guardian of it until the day that he hands the responsibility of that over to her husband. And like in my youth group climate, well first, what is the purity ball you went to like? Yeah, it was very similar. So as I mentioned, I grew up in Colorado Springs, which was actually the birthplace of purity balls. That's where they originated. So they were a pretty common thing when I was growing up and they were just that. It felt very much like a wedding ceremony. I think that my friend was actually wearing a wedding gown and had a dance with her father like you would on a wedding day. And yeah, it was not too separate from a wedding ceremony. And it was essentially her pledging, as you said, her virginity, her body to her father who would hold her virginity for her. Yeah, I would agree. At the time it was normal. And part of that is because of my own disembodiment and my own indoctrination into the system. But even at the time, I felt a lot of shame and disgust, but I always channeled that back at my own body because I didn't have I what I am not asexual. And so I had a lot of shame about desire or arousal or even crushes that I had because that felt like I wasn't doing purity right. And so a lot of it required kind of this trying to de-sexualize myself and sever myself from my own identity and orientation. Oh, OK. I really hate to do this to you, but I don't know. You seem like you OK, just because you brought up the idea of arousal. And I know that there is like so much shame around that, especially for youth group kids. And just OK, really quick. Yes or no question. Is it bad and wrong to masturbate or jerk off or whatever you call it? No. No. OK. Whoa. OK. So anyway, thanks for. Whoa. OK. So OK. So back to the idea that that's just for all of you listening out there. Yeah, I wish Jenny was my mom. This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.

OK, so in my youth group Climax, we do a lot of activities around like purity culture. Like we give each other promise rings. Sometimes that feels like a popularity thing. But like we chew up sticks of gum to represent what having sex does to your human value. And we like pluck chickens to see how they're beautiful and feathery in their virginity. And then they become these sad, wet, naked disasters. Like that is what happens if you have sex too. And like sometimes we cut out paper hearts and then we rip them to shreds to represent the destruction that's caused by sexuality. But like you're the purity culture researcher. So like what is purity culture? Like is it something that only Christians do and perpetuate and everything? And like how do you know if you come from a purity culture? Yeah. Well, first a very short answer. What you just described is definitely a purity culture. It's very safe to say that you are immersed in a purity culture. OK, OK. And, you know, one of the things I'll say before I answer the question about purity culture that could be a shock, but I think that's really important to understand is that virginity is a social construct. Whoa. It actually has no biological meaning to it other than the meaning we ascribe to it. Oh, my mom is going to hate this. And I'm aware I am a grown woman talking to you, so I won't necessarily get into the nitty gritty if that feels uncomfortable. Although I'm happy to explain that just more from more of an anatomical stance, because I think that understanding anatomy and biology helps dispel a lot of the myths around purity culture. OK, yes. But also, you know, as we're talking about consent, we'd love to check in with you and see how that feels and if that feels comfortable. Oh, wow. Thank you so much for asking. Yeah, I like, of course, anything having to do with a human body, I always feel like I'm not allowed to be talking about it. So I'm overcoming that. But I like as soon as you described it in like educational terms and like I'm going to hang on to that phrase virginity is a social construct because mostly it's going to drive my mom crazy. That's good. But also, yeah, I'm totally comfortable with you explaining why that's the case anatomically. OK, yeah. And if at any point that shifts, feel free to let me know. OK. But I think it's important to understand what I will say is there are many different types of purity culture. So when I'm talking about purity culture, I am talking about a specific movement that started a little bit before the 90s because abstinence only education was infused into schools during the Reagan administration. But it really took off in the 1990s, particularly in 1993. There was this huge giant rally called True Love Waits where hundreds of thousands of adolescents took little cards that were their virginity pledges. And they pledged them on a lawn of a mall. And it was this huge statement. And then after that, there were so many books that were written like I Kissed Dating Goodbye or various things that perpetuated this idea of maintaining, quote unquote, purity, which meant virginity until marriage. But again, because virginity is a social construct, this purity comes with a lot of expectations and assumptions and binary thinking. So it assumes that there is only men or only male and only female or those socialized as men or socialized as women. And it is a very heteronormative concept that says virginity is only lost when someone with a male body penetrates someone with a female body. But there are many different types and ways that people of all genders and all sexes have intimacy with one another. But a lot of the idea of losing virginity comes from a long, long history of patriarchy and control over women's bodies based on a myth that the hymen is this organ that somehow pops or bursts or opens when a female body has sex for the first time. But all the hymen is when someone is in a female body and they're in utero, their vagina is a solid tube. And then as they develop, that tube gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes there's a little bit of tissue left. Sometimes it's almost like a croissant shape. Sometimes it covers the whole opening, but it's different for every body. And sometimes it can be impacted from riding a bike. Sometimes it can be impacted by sex, sometimes not. And so it's all essentially based on this idea of quote unquote protecting, but really controlling primarily white female bodies in this system. But that control also disproportionately impacts bodies that aren't white or straight or cisgender or able bodied or this kind of epitome of what a pure body looks like. How does it affect those other bodies that aren't like white ladies? Yeah, in many different ways. One that comes to mind is that through the idea of abstinence only education, a lot of times there is a war against providing contraceptives and birth control and abortion care. And due to the economic disparities in our country, black and brown bodies are disproportionately impacted by not having access to contraceptives or abortion care. And so there becomes more and more of a disparity in economics based on whose bodies get to be quote unquote pure and whose don't. And often LGBTQ bodies are left out of the conversation altogether, or they are assigned as hyper sinful and there's something extra wrong with them because they don't fit into this heteronormative cisgender structure. And that can really impact both through an internalized sense of shame, but also through an external oppression and hatred and harm that comes against bodies of color and the LGBTQ community. That sucks. Yeah, it's pretty devastating. That really sucks. And so it's like a big part of that like preserving white, pure women. Like is one of the impacts of that that they're saying that women of color, that their bodies aren't like even like part of the purity culture, they're not even, they don't care to like try to protect that or keep that quote unquote pure or whatever. Yeah, absolutely. And that doesn't mean that, you know, women of color or people in a female body that are people of color didn't experience purity culture, because they certainly did. And there's many variations of purity culture. And to go back to your question, you know, we're seeing in Iran right now, the movement of women life freedom is fighting against the Islamic form of purity culture that's taken over the government there. And there's so many different nuances and complexities, but in the United States, the white evangelical Christian purity culture structure prioritizes, well it prioritizes white cis male bodies, but then it also prioritizes white cis female bodies in proximity to white male bodies. So power and privilege are given in in how close or far away they are from the white straight cis male body. Man, patriarchy, huh? Yeah, it's rough. And that's why it makes me so encouraged that someone your age and of your gender is asking such really important questions. Oh, thank you. That's cool. Well, I honestly, there are a few questions I have for you today that come from how unsatisfying a lot of the answers I've gotten at church are. And, um, yeah. Um, so, because I go to a public school, but, um, I don't know, like speaking of education, like, okay, I was going to tell you that one time they separated us by gender in our health class. And, um, and then my teacher Mr. Boggs, he drew these fallopian tubes on the board and was like doing this whole thing but my friend Brooklyn he started laughing so hard that he farted and then we all were laughing he got a detention and we couldn't tell Mr. Boggs, it was more that it sounded like that, um, that my friend Brooklyn like gambled on a fart and lost we thought he like filled his pants and with it, but he got a detention and then my mom and then we didn't get to finish with the tubes and everything and my mom was, she was so disgusted that she wrote a note that I wasn't allowed to go to health class on the sex ed days and but then I never turned it in but um I guess my question is, is it okay for like junior high age and high school age kids to know, like the anatomy of their own body and the bodies of others. Is it okay to know that stuff. I absolutely think it's not only okay I think it's really important that we understand the diversity of bodies and especially our own body and the the anger and the hatred towards bodies specifically when we're talking about reproductive organs or genitalia is a symptom of purity culture. We don't come into the world afraid to learn about our bodies we're touching our bodies we're touching other people's bodies circling back to consent of course as we get older we learn to ask people if it's okay if we touch their body or engage their body, but we don't come into the world with a lot of shame or hesitation to explore our body that's something that we learn. Yeah we used to play in the hose naked in the front yard. Right, right, exactly. It's such a human and just, you know, it's, well, yeah, yeah, I could go on a tangent about it that the how much we've been socialized into shaming our bodies that is is part of a history of colonialism and white supremacy where there are humans today in various parts of the world that are okay showing their bodies. And often that was actually used as justification for colonialism was these people are hypersexual or these people have diverse genders or these people have polyamorous relationships so we need to quote unquote Christianize them, which often meant slapping on some clothes and gender binary and really heteronormative ways of engaging the world. Whoa, that's so fascinating and I never did think about it but like one of my earliest memories is that like my little swimmers diaper got too heavy and my mom took it off of me and I just kept it in and I didn't care. In fact, it felt good to lose the little swimmers and um yeah now I would never I would like, die I like a bad dreams about like not having myself totally covered all right, it's so normal and it's so common especially when we live in a culture where everyone else is doing that then we feel like we have to or we should do that. But the other thing I would say too about what you shared is that you know it's it's concerning to me that you were separated by gender, because that then perpetuates this false myth that gender and even sex are binary. Right. And there is many ways that someone may relate to their gender and it's not the same as sex and even in sex we have roughly as many intersex bodies in the world as there are bodies with red hair. And so that's to say there are a lot of bodies that have some variation of a penis and a vagina or a penis and breasts or a different hormonal differences and variations so there's there's no real binary when it comes to sex or gender. There's an incredibly beautiful spectrum in between. Wow, that is so cool. But like, okay, but my mom would say that like, if I am comfortable with my body and I understand its physiology or whatever, I'm not more apt to them to get out there with this body and like take it for a ride you know what I mean like, like, you know, like once I know how to play Minecraft, I'm gonna play it right like and that's what my mom says is like if you know about your body then you'll use it and that's like the worst thing you can do. Well, I guess if you are coming from an ideology that says that that's the worst thing you can do that might be true. But if you get to come from a mindset that having sex or exploring intimacy is just like playing Minecraft, then it doesn't actually become something bad or scary. You and this is why it's important I think to learn about your body and anatomy because you might need, you know, certain things to protect yourself and you might need certain things to protect your partners. But that doesn't mean that getting out and exploring your body is bad or dangerous. It might be bad and dangerous to a system that wants you to be robotic and disembodied. But it doesn't mean that it's actually bad and as you mentioned your friend earlier who's asexual, just because someone's in their body doesn't mean they're going to want to have sex. Somebody might really be in their body but they might not have a desire or an arousal for sex. And of course asexual people can have sex as well but it doesn't mean that everybody wants to. It's just listening to your own body and your own hedonic tone to say, I like this, I don't like that, I'm curious about this, I'd never want to do that, that can grow your sense of agency and empowerment in your body. I have, I know I have a trans friend named Zach and I have a non-binary friend named May and it's interesting because most of the time my mom doesn't pick up on it but if she does notice they, them pronouns she just switches it back to binary pronouns and she's like I won't do that day. So, but I don't know I kind of feel like that's like dehumanizing them because she's not even recognizing their humanity. Yeah, that makes me really sad to hear about and unfortunately that's really really common, especially in this country, that there is a dehumanizing of transgender folks and non-binary folks and gender fluid folks. Because the system that we live in thrives off of believing that there is a gender binary. Capitalism doesn't exactly work if we don't have a gender binary. Capitalism doesn't work if we don't have a gender binary? Oh, that'd be great because I would love to get rid of capitalism. Absolutely, I mean, especially you know in the huge exponential growth of capitalism post World War Two happened because quote unquote women stayed at home with the kids and quote unquote men went to work. And so our entire labor force and of course this is primarily white women and white men that the capitalistic system preferences to say, you know, we are going to make women do free labor, and we're not going to compensate them, and then we're going to have men go to work and get the quote unquote real job. And so we don't have a system that enables bodies of all gender to explore what type of work, what type of freedom, what type of expression they might want to have. It's so much harder because our, you know, country really thrives off of the legalization of certain types of marriage and certain types of bodies. Yeah, man, you have really pretty hands. Oh, thank you. What's up everybody. Okay, do you guys know that even if we all ate the same and exercise the same that we would all still look completely different.

Um, some people are some groups or whatever nowadays are like banning books and threatening librarians and bookstores have you heard about this, I have yeah like because they say that like any adult who shares, even if it's like factual or educational information with adolescents like they'll be punished and stuff. And like, I don't know I feel like when I was younger, and I was learning about like Stalin burning books and fascist leaders and before that was like all the scary times that like now we're more modern or whatever so it's sort of weird that that's back because I even remember in church I grew up believing that like banning books is a sign of authoritarian regimes and it's like we're we're to stuff you know and like we, we learned from that we knew those were the bad guys and we were trying to be the good guys and but now it feels like people are like, even the church used to say like, we don't need to burn books because if the Bible is true truth stands the test of time and so we have confidence enough in the Bible that we don't have to burn books at least that's kind of what I thought. And, and now it feels like people are forgetting history and like doomed to repeat it and also, I do just also want to say, and maybe this doesn't help me at all but like to all these people trying to ban books don't they know that porn is online now and extremely easy to access especially for those of us who have grown up with screens and we're like much smarter with technology than our parents, because like, oh my gosh, Jenny I mean one time, my mom found a VHS tape of strip tease on top of the entertainment system. And I got in so much trouble and I was like I don't watch VHS tapes I don't even have I don't. And, and, and I was like that's dads, and I think my dad had rented strip tease and, and he told, and he said to my he told my mom that I got it with my library card and I'm like I don't even go in the library I only skateboard outside the library but anyway, I was falsely accused I'm sorry but the question is like, is it okay for responsible adults to have like, you know, open conversations with young people or should we like restrict information for those people's safety. Yeah, I think it is so important to have accurate information about bodies about history about gender, about sexuality, and I think you're actually you're absolutely right you know it terrifies me to see what's happening right now in our country with burn bands or book bands, and, you know, honestly what comes to mind is that this also happened during the Nazi regime, where the sexology Institute was looted. And it was known as an Institute that was for transgender folks for gay folks, it was doing so much good to research and provide care for the queer community. And it was looted and burned, and what was really tragic and also powerful is that in one of the books, the author had written where they burn books in the end they will burn humans to. Whoa. And it was it was a foreshadowing of what happened, you know, the concentration camps, included homosexual people that were rounded up and sent there because of their identity and because of their orientation. And I think that tyrants and systems of power thrive off of miseducation and under education. And, you know, this isn't exactly related to now but what honestly comes to mind is that this has been going on not only since World War Two, but this went on with what we now know of as the New Testament, because until the year 467, there were many other books that were Gospels that were epistles that were letters and there was one man named Athanasius, who came up with the 27 books that are now in the New Testament and decried that all of the rest of them were inappropriate and should be burned and destroyed. And we see what that led to in the way in which there's been a dogma formed around certain types of literature that was let into the New Testament. And so this is a pattern of history for a very, very, very long time to try to stifle different ways of thinking, to stifle feminist ways of thinking, to stifle queer ways of thinking that don't function in this dogmatic binary all or nothing spirit or flesh, good or bad way. Yeah. Like, Jenny, are you, are you familiar with the Gospel of Thomas? This is something that I've been learning about lately because it didn't make it in the canon of the Bible. Yeah, I am a little bit. Do you know about how it ends? Yeah, it's pretty fascinating.

Purity culture, according to McGrath, originated in Colorado Springs in the 1990s as a movement promoting chastity until marriage, particularly among white evangelical Christians. McGrath suggests that this culture, rooted in patriarchy and control over women's bodies, supports the binary concept of gender and excludes people of color and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. The conversation takes a critical tone towards this culture's impact on youth education and understanding of their bodies. \n\nThe podcast delves into the concepts of consent, hedonic tone (understanding what one likes or doesn't like), and de-sexualization practices in purity culture. McGrath mentions the harmful effects of excluding LGBTQIA+ and non-white individuals in purity culture narratives. She emphasizes the significance of understanding diverse body types, sexes, and orientations, and the inaccuracies inherent in binary perspectives on sex and gender. She also stresses the importance of open, factual communication about bodies and sexual health. This was seen as particularly controversial in light of attempts to ban books and control such information. \n\nThe episode also explored the societal consequences of purity culture on the norms of capitalist society, relating patriarchal gender norms to economic disparities among genders and races. McGrath even ties the issue back to the erasure of certain texts from the New Testament, exemplifying the age-old practice of stifling alternative or subversive narratives, contributing to a monolithic perspective. \n\nOverall, the conversation is casual yet insightful, filled with threads of humor and surprise as the host learns of perspectives contrary to conventionally accepted evangelical norms. The overall tone remains respectful and centered around conscientious learning.", "podcast_guest": {"name": "Jenny McGrath", "organization": "indwellcounseling.com", "title": "Licensed Mental Health Counselor", "summary": "Jenny McGrath is a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, a Somatic Experiencing\u00ae Practitioner, a Certified Yoga Teacher, and an Approved Supervisor.

The podcast guest is Jenny McGrath, a licensed mental health counselor, somatic experiencing practitioner, and a purity culture researcher. She shares how she, herself, grew up in purity culture in Colorado Springs, and even begged her parents for a purity ring when she turned 13, connecting it to the desire to feel like she was being good.\n\n2. McGrath explains how her own body's breakdown led her to her current profession. After living in Northern Uganda as a missionary, she found herself experiencing physical issues that pushed her into researching trauma's impact on the body.\n\n3. McGrath explains that purity culture often leads to a disembodied and disassociated state, which serves to keep individuals complying with the system's expectations. This links with her assertion of the importance of the concept of consent, which requires a strong awareness of one's body and one's likes and dislikes. \n\n4. McGrath opines on the origins of the idea of a separate body and soul, stating it came from Plato. Before Plato, the body and soul were seen as one, animated through one\u2019s breath or the breath of God.\n\n5. McGrath confirms that masturbation is not bad or wrong, countering the pervasive idea in purity culture that bodies are inherently dirty or wrong.\n\n6. McGrath further dives into the specifics of purity culture. She outlines that virginity is a social construct that holds both cultural and personal consequences for those who do not adhere to the system\u2019s expectations.\n\n7. McGrath touches upon the impact of purity culture on non-white, non-cisgender, and non-heteronormative bodies, discussing the disparate effects of a system that prioritizes white cis bodies.\n\n8. McGrath asserts the importance of knowing one's body, understanding biology, gender, and sexuality, not only for personal awareness but also in allowing diversity to flourish and minimizing the shame culture fostered by purity culture.\n\nControversial or Heavily Debated Points:\n\n1. McGrath's stance on virginity and masturbation is likely to have been hotly debated as these counteract widely held beliefs in many evangelical Christian and purity culture groups. \n\n2. The argument that consent is a necessary part of being human and should be practiced in every aspect of life, such as sexual interaction, might be seen as controversial within communities that believe in surrendering individual will to God's plan.\n\n3. The assertion that virginity is a social construct would likely be controversial within communities that traditionally value it highly.\n\n4. McGrath\u2019s discussion on the impact of purity culture on non-white, non-cisgender, and non-heteronormative bodies might be seen as controversial due to the often polarized views on gender identity and race in society at large. \n\n5. The claims about current societal trends like banning books and controlling the spread of informational resources among adolescents could be controversial, that can be seen as encroaching on freedom of expression and access to necessary information.\n\n6. The connection McGrath makes between capitalism and the gender binary might be a contentious topic, as it implicates economic structures in maintaining outdated societal norms.\n"}
